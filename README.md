# Todo App Hackathon Project

This is a simple **Todo App** developed as part of a hackathon project with new UI improvements and features for better usability and interactivity. The app allows users to manage their tasks, set due dates, and track their progress easily. Here’s a quick overview of the project, its features, and changes.

## Main Changes

1. **Prompt for User Name**: If no name is entered, the app uses "Anonymous" by default.
2. **Task Toggle and Deletion Sound**: Added sound effects when toggling task completion or deleting a task for better user feedback.
3. **Enhanced Toggle Design**: The checkbox for marking tasks complete is now more stylish.
4. **Input Form**: The task input form has been moved to the bottom for easier access, with a built-in date picker to set due dates (saved in local storage).
5. **Dynamic Colors for Due Dates**: Due dates are now displayed with color-coded buttons, indicating task urgency. For example:
   - **Red**: Overdue tasks
   - **Green**: Tasks due soon
6. **Stylish Add Button**: The button for adding tasks has been redesigned for a more modern look.

## Features

1. **Navbar**: A revamped navbar now includes logos of **BBD** and **GDG**, adding a professional touch to the interface.
2. **Task Toggling**: The checkmark for toggling task completion has been improved to be more visually appealing.
3. **Dynamic Due Dates**: The due date of each task is shown with color-coded buttons to reflect the task’s urgency:
   - **Red**: Tasks overdue by several days
   - **Green**: Tasks due soon
   - **Blue**: Tasks due today
4. **Stylish Input Form**: The form for adding tasks is now at the bottom of the app and includes a **date picker** for selecting due dates.
5. **Local Storage**: Due dates and tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so your tasks are retained even if you close the app.
6. **Sound Effects**: Added sounds for task toggling and deletion to enhance user interaction and make task management more fun.
